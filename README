# Berlin CLI

## Description

Command-line interface for the [Berlin programming language](https://github.com/dchacke/berlin-lang). It is currently used only for transpilation (from Berlin to JavaScript).

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install berlin-cli -g
```

## Usage

```bash
$ berlin input.berlin output.js
```

with `input.berlin` containing Berlin source code, and output.js being newly created by the CLI. If output.js already exists, it will be overwritten.
